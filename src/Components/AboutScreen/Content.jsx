            Welcome to my portfolio!
            I'm Jeevith, a passionate Flutter Developer crafting sleek, high-performance mobile apps that run beautifully on both Android and iOS. With over 2 years of experience, I specialize in building responsive UIs and integrating backend services using Flutter, Dart, Firebase, and REST APIs.
            <br />
            <br />
           I believe great apps are more than just code â€” they should feel intuitive, look stunning, and solve real user problems. My focus is always on clean architecture, pixel-perfect design, and smooth user experience that stands out in todayâ€™s crowded app market.
            <br />
            <br />
            Whether it's a startup idea or a growing product, I bring creativity, technical skill, and a strong user-first mindset to the table. Iâ€™m always learning, always building â€” and always ready to take on the next challenge.
